# Mentorium Emporium

For Project 2 we were tasked with designing and building our first full-stack web application. The process was initialised by us brainstorming ideas to execute a design that solves a real-world problem. For us, the idea of Mentorium Emporium evolved as it related to us being web developer students ourselves. We then delegated roles within our team to play to people's strengthes for the front-end and the back-end. Our team designed and built an app using the MVC paradigm, creating our own server-side API, adding user authentication, and connecting to a database. This project prompted us to use our existing front-end abilities and solidify our understanding of the dynamic between the front end and back end.

## What is Mentorium Emporium
Mentorium Emporium is a full-stack web application that has been developed to connect aspiring developers with experienced developers through our mentoring programme. Our program focuses on the strengths of the Mentors based on coding languages and matches the Mentees based on their selected languages requiring development. Mentees are presented with their Mentor matches and can select a mentor to view their availability to request an appointment. Mentors can then approve the mentee appointment request The appointments are then presented on the userâ€™s profile.
